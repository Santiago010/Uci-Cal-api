/** This is a revised NITF_PackingPlan rectifying the problems identified in NITF_PackingPlanType. It is a tailored
  * reproduction of data definitions included in NITF 2.1 as described in MIL-STD-2500C, MIL-STD-2500B Notice 2, and
  * companion appendices STDI-0002 Compendium Nov 2000 and IPON v1.0_01 August 2007. These data must flow from Task or
  * Command source to recipient so that the recipient can populate the resulting Products with this data to enable PED
  * and other functions. Under most circumstances, UCI doesn't reproduce other standards "in-band", in UCI messages. An
  * exception is made in this case because to do otherwise would disrupt C2 and PED. NOTES: 1) Annotations for these
  * fields specify where the source data can be obtained from an ACTDF message from AOC Cougar system. But note that
  * tasking can come in other forms such as target deck spreadsheets, email, chat, CMCC operator GUIs, etc. 2) The NITF
  * Basic Character Set - Alphanumeric (BCS-A) is all ASCII characters between SPACE and TILDE show as patterns herein as
  * "[ -~]", 2) The NITF Extended Character Set - Alphanumeric (ECS-A), is a subset of the Extended Character Set (ECS).
  * Valid ECS-A character codes range from 0x20 to 0x7E, and 0xA0 to 0xFF but Line Feed (0x0A), Form Feed (0x0C) and
  * Carriage Return (0x0D) are not valid ECS-A characters. This range is expressed herein in patterns as "[ -~ -ÿ]".
  * Because of inconsistencies between standards, it is strongly advised that character codes ranging from 0xA0 to 0xFF
  * should never be used. Therefore, the use of ECS-A characters should be restricted to its BCS-A Subset.
