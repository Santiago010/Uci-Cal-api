  * five-digit tail number. For most USAF aircraft, the first two digits of the tail number are the fiscal year that the
  * aircraft was ordered, and the remaining digits are the last three digits of the airframe's serial number. US Civil
  * aircraft are identified by a two to six character alphanumeric registration number assigned by the ICAO or FAA.
  * International tail numbers (registrations) follow similar patterns, but may be up to 10 characters long, often
  * containing a dash separating the country code from the specific alphanumeric registration.; [Minimum length: 2]
  * [Maximum length: 10] [Pattern: "[A-Z0-9\-]{2,10}"]
