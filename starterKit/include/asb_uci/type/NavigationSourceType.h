    * @param type = uci::base::accessorType::null The type of data that is to be made available when the ordinal is set.
    *      The use of this parameter provides support for inheritable types. This parameter defaults to
    *      uci::base::accessorType::null that is used to indicate that the access methods associated with the chosen
    *      element shall provide access to data of the type that was specified for that element in the choice in the OMS
    *      schema, i.e. the chosen element's base type. If specified, this field must either be a type ID associated with
    *      the chosen element's base type or a type ID associated with a type that is derived from the chosen element's
    *      base type.
    * @return A reference to the accessor that provides access to the choice identified by SlavedNavigation.
