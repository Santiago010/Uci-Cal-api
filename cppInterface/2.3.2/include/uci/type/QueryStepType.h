  * tree (Element, Descendant, and Child), or remain at the current context. Steps are evaluated sequentially from the
  * current context, with the default context of a query as the root of the tree, i.e. the top-level global element
  * declaration. The result of each Step forms a sequence of zero or more nodes that is then used as the input to the
  * next Step, where each node of the input sequence is used as the current context with all sequences concatenated
  * together, repeated until all Steps are evaluated. Each node in this sequence is either a present optional field, a
  * required field, or an item in a list. For example, a Step that matches a list field with a length of two will result
  * in a sequence of two nodes. The resulting sequence is then evaluated by the query with a given operation. Some
  * operations, such as Equals, that operate on a single value are instead performed on each individual node in the
  * sequence and the result is computed by the logical OR of all the results.
