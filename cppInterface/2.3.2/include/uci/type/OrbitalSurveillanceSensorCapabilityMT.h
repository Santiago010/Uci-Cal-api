/** This message indicates that a subsystem is capable of performing an Orbital Surveillance Sensor activity in the
  * domain generally characterized by altitudes greater than 100 km above Earth's surface and less than interplanetary
  * ranges. Orbital Surveillance Sensor involves the use of a single sensor to search for and/or collect information on a
  * target, multiple targets or region of space to help meet a specific Information Objective. The focus of an Orbital
  * Surveillance Sensor activity (identified under the specification of Target) can be location based, object based, or
  * zone based and targets can be in equilibrium orbits (affected only by natural forces) or under powered flight.
  * Examples of information objectives achieved through sensor collects include achieving or maintaining a certain level
  * of orbit accuracy, verifying that there are no unknown objects in a specific region of space or with certain orbital
  * parameters, determining the structural elements of a target down to a specified resolution, determining the current
  * operational configuration of a target, or something as specific as providing a baseline characterization of a target
  * in a specific phenomenology to be used for future change-detection. This message advertises a subsystem's mostly
  * static characteristics for a mission-ready Orbital Surveillance Sensor Capability to other systems, which enables
  * proper commanding of the capability.
