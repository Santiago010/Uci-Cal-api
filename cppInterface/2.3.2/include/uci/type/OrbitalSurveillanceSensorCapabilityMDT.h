/** Indicates that a subsystem is capable of performing an Orbital Surveillance Sensor activity in the domain generally
  * characterized by altitudes greater than 100 km above Earth's surface and less than interplanetary ranges. Orbital
  * Surveillance Sensor involves the use of sensors of various different phenomenologies to search for and/or collect
  * information on a target, multiple targets or region of space in support of an Information Objective. The focus of an
  * Orbital Surveillance Sensor activity (identified under the specification of Target) can be location based, object
  * based, or zone based and targets can be in equilibrium orbits (affected only by natural forces) or under powered
  * flight. Examples of information objectives achieved through sensor collects include achieving or maintaining a
  * certain level of orbit accuracy, verifying that there are no unknown objects in a specific region of space or with
  * certain orbital parameters, determining the structural elements of a target down to a specified resolution,
  * determining the current operational configuration of a target, or something as specific as providing a baseline
  * characterization of a target in a specific phenomenology to be used for future change-detection. This message
  * advertises a subsystem's mostly static characteristics for a mission-ready Orbital Surveillance Sensor Capability to
  * other systems, which enables proper commanding of the capability.
